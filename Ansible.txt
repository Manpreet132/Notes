 History of Automation:
 
1. Bash Scripting/ Batch Scripting.
2. Python/PERL/Ruby.
3. Powershell.
4. Puppet.
5. Salt Stack.
6. Chef: It has its own programming language.
7. Ansible: It is a configuration management tool. It is written in python and simple to manage .
8. Terraform: It is mainly used in cloud insfrastructure automation.


We can use ansible in any system automation, for production server changes , setup servers from scratch/cloud provisioning,databases. It is simple tool. There is no need to setup agents in ansible and it does not have any server.
Chef,puppet and Ansible are configuration management tools.
Configuration management tools helps to create single script for configuration on different servers(Linux,Windows).
Chef and Puppet use agenst system , like we have to install them on different servers and write code of them, and we have to learn languages like Python ,ruby etc.
In Ansible , we have to learn yaml and it is agentless.
In Ansible, control node is where we install ansible and throught control node we can manage configuration of other nodes called managed nodes.
Ansible can also be used in provisioning like terraform and deployment in cicd.
With shell script we cannot install application on different types of vms, with python we can do that , bit it is more complex task.
Ansible solves these problems,because we only have to learn yaml language.
Control node and manage node should have python in ansible.
Control node where ansible is installed can call managed nodes without password.
Ansible inventory in a file that contains list of managed nodes.
