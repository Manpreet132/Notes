In CNN , data is is in the form of images and video frames.
Sequence of text and information is very important in terms for sequential data.
Bsed on the sequence , sentence makes meaning.
In nLP, we convert text data to vectors, and vectors to numerical representation.
Word embeddings are numerical representation of words, this is usseful because we need numbers form data to train model.
Sequential information is very important to make the context clear.
In sequential data , we can't give all data to input at one timeframe only, instead we have to give it by one by one.
So, we use RNN for this sequential data.
In this previous context information will also be retained by RNN.
One Hot Encoding converts each word to vector.
In Multiclass classification we use softmax, in binary is sigmoid activation function.
Long term dependency cannot be captured by RNN, so it is not effectice in long texts.
Derivative of sigmoid ranges from 0 to 0.25.

Streamlit is an open source app framework for data science and machine learning applications.
Words are converted into the vectors through embedding layer using word embeddings.
