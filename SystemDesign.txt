System Design and OOPS designs is separate.
OOPS design basically focuses on classes.
To understand design patterns SOLID principle and design patters is required.
In SQL , main objective is that every information is stored once in database.
Wheen there are multiple relations in tables , queries becomes complex amd slow.
So alternative is nosql database.
Types of NOSQL databases are: key-value db, document db,GRAPH DB.
We represent document db as JSON.
When the data is highly interconnected , we uses graph db , for eg. social media.
In CAP theorem:
Consistency: System shoulod be consistent, all the nodes should see the same data at same time.In cluster of nodes , if we update one node, all nodes
should be updated at same time.
Availability:System should always be available , It should return response whther positive or negative. 
Partition tolerance: System can withstand network filaure the entire system shiuld not fail iof some components are not working.
In ideal distribution system , we can only achieve 2 out of 3.
Sharding is splitting up the database across multiple machines to improve the scalability of application.
It is horizontal scaling.
Vertical partitioning is based on features.
There is directory based partitioning also.
